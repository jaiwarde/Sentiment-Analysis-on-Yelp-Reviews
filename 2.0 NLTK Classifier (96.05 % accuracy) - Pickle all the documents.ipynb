Security is at the door. Be careful because the will try to charge you to park on the right hand side of restaurant.</td>\n",

First time they were great the second time it was a bunch of lazy guys .  I made it clear that I would not use them again.  I had been looking at the removal places that charge by weight and decided to try them.  I chose 505 Junk.  They were great.  They arrived on time , they were polite and friendly (nothing worse than hiring someone you will be paying and they are surly and rude and don't want to complete the task) I think it was always a different team and they were all excellent.  The weight factor was always a lot less $ than the other place that guessed how much to charge.  505 Junk weighs it on the truck.

The last three orders, made on an iPhone Xr were really a hassle. Who ever owns this restaurant should try to place an order with a smart phone as a guest. You'd probably consider changing the method for ordering after that. I'm not a technophobe. I have a Mac and PC, iPhone and Android phone. I'm online all day and work on my company website all the time. I asked the young woman ahead of me when I picked up my order (which I came within an inch of not bothering with) whether she'd had a problem and she did. So it's not just me. Fix the way you take online orders please.\\n\\nOriginal 5-Star Rating:\\nThis place is the first place I ever had Ramen (at the old location). You had to be prepared to wait, but the wait was worth it.\\n\\nThere's also a North location that I've been to as well. They moved the South location a while ago to a larger place with better parking. If you come during regular hours you should be prepared to wait though.\\n\\nRamen is a bowl of noodles and other things in broth. The broth is key. The pork bone broth at this place is out of this world. Just fabulous. On my last visit I had ground pork with various veggies in my Ramen. The richness of the broth made this an extremely memorable meal. Tasty, filling and quite reasonable.\\n\\nI enjoy the Ramen at Tatsu-Ya even more than the Ramen we had in Tokyo 2 years ago.

Yeah... uhhhh.... not getting my business, sorry but no thanks. I'm just glad I get to write a Yelp review about it so that others can also make an informed decision on whether to support their business.   \n",

Oh my gosh it's crisp not oily but covered generously in sauce!! Good portion for the price you pay. The only thing that was concerning was that I ordered a spicy tuna roll and I was told it will only take 5 minutes. At first I let the server know that's it's ok And I'll pass on the roll as I was dining with a group who was pretty much done eatting. The server reassured me that  my order would be second in line and it won't take long so I ended up ordering it. Unfortunately, the roll came 20 minutes later. It's no ones fault and I understand completely so I'm still going to give them 5 stars. The roll was worth the wait!   \n",

You have to wear a mask before you enter, and you sit yourself. They do have a bar area to sit at also.  Our waitress was so slow  on our order. Our wings came out fast and made correctly.  They were very salty. They potatoes dippers are good.  \\nFrench fries were not made fresh,  they sat under a light.  Potato dippers were made to order.  Asked for lemon in Sprite and never received and waitress didn't come back and check on us. \\n\\nThey don't clean their tables fast after customers so other customers are standing at the door to sit but no clean tables.  Security is at the door. Be careful because the will try to charge you to park on the right hand side of restaurant.   \n",

Even though I was the 2nd person in the shop, I still waited about 10 minutes for 2 drinks. I thought it was pretty slow but my drink turned out ok. I don't think this is staple for me to come back every time but glad there's something at Bridgeport.   \n",

The guy behind the counter whined like a 5 year needing a nap for 2 minutes telling me I should have come in earlier. After whining about the repair for a minute and then reverting back to whining about coming in earlier, I walked out and drove to Newton to CTS computer who are the best and worth the drive.   \n",

First time they were great the second time it was a bunch of lazy guys .  I made it clear that I would not use them again.  I had been looking at the removal places that charge by weight and decided to try them.  I chose 505 Junk.  They were great.  They arrived on time , they were polite and friendly (nothing worse than hiring someone you will be paying and they are surly and rude and don't want to complete the task) I think it was always a different team and they were all excellent.  The weight factor was always a lot less $ than the other place that guessed how much to charge.  505 Junk weighs it on the truck.  A friend is moving and she has used them too, also very pleased with them.   \n",

For this price point, they really cheaped out. \\nWe also ordered pork belly rice which was OK, nothing special. Seems more like chopped up dark meat chicken than pork belly.\\nThe only good things were the tea eggs and pickled veggies.   \n",

Room decor is pleasing to the eye.  Comfortable and clean bed and room.  Bathroom felt luxurious.   The TV even has a Netflix option!  Cons:  I was promised access to a microwave upon confirmation of my reservation.  When I was in my room and needed to use it, I was denied access.  Very disappointing.  Cold food is no fun.  Only other complaint:  Rude, nasty spirited staff at reception overnight and at check out.   \n",

I completely messed up the reservation and booked for Friday instead of Saturday! Dee at check in could not find my reservation but soon figured out my mistake. He could not have been any nicer about it and was able to get us another room at the same rate. Fantastic customer service from Dee and all the other staff we encountered.   \n",

Things happen in business, they do with my business too. It absolutely shows the character of a company and how it is run when you get an immediate response to an issue. The President called me, emailed me, and reached out on Yelp. He was very apologetic and made it right with me. I feel confident that when there is a hiccup they will take care of it. I am very pleased!\\n\\n I had an appointment at 11:00 it is 2:30 on a gorgeous Saturday. I have been home all day waiting for service. Still no one.\\n\\nIt is now 4 hours from my appointment time. No call, no update. I called before they closed they said they were running late. It's not like they didn't know about my appointment. Very unhappy.\\n\\nHe finally showed, poor kid said he didn't know he was supposed to work. Totally get that, I've missed something for work too. If the office would have communicated I could have decided to leave and reschedule. There was no communication from anyone.   \n",

I guess technically you might be 6 ft minimum from another person but you have a person in every single direction of you sitting 6 ft from your face to their face. Did not feel covid safe so we wore our masks the whole time until our meal came out then put them back on. Food was great and our server was super nice which is why I'm giving 4 stars because covid sucks and I dont want to base my review off pandemic practices because it feels unfair BUT it's important to note for people making reservations that this might not be the place during covid.   \n",

It REALLY disappointed me to find out the newer management has changed from a Co-op of members who enjoy the outdoors and want to have access to high quality climbing gear and outdoor apparel at a reasonable price!. At least that's what it is SUPPOSED to be about. Unfortunately now it had turned into the typically overpriced, very UN-co-op like retail space.\\nThat being  said, the woman who works upstairs in shoes is WONDERFUL!!!!!. I should have written this review a while back when I bought my boots but better late than never!. SHE IS WHAT EVERY SALES PERSON SHOULD BE\\nIf REI still had the same a philosophy I would have given 5 stars......   \n",

Tonight I found myself disappointed with the quality. The crispy noodles with chicken was good. However, I also ordered the seafood and tofu soup. Last time I had the soup it was really tasty. This time I opened it and was immediately taken aback by the color of the tofu pieces. At first I wasn't sure if these were pieces of tofu, but indeed they are.\\n\\nI ate a bit of the soup but soon decided it wasn't worth the risk. I'm sad to have wasted $13. I truly appreciate that this restaurant has been open, and I can't imagine how difficult it is for them during a pandemic. I just hope that moving forward they check the quality of the food that they're serving for the safety of their customers.   \n",
       "19  Sadly, I'm changing this to a 2-Stars. Although the quality of the to-go only food is still great, it's VERY difficult to order it. The last three orders, made on an iPhone Xr were really a hassle. Who ever owns this restaurant should try to place an order with a smart phone as a guest. You'd probably consider changing the method for ordering after that. I'm not a technophobe. I have a Mac and PC, iPhone and Android phone. I'm online all day and work on my company website all the time. I asked the young woman ahead of me when I picked up my order (which I came within an inch of not bothering with) whether she'd had a problem and she did. So it's not just me. Fix the way you take online orders please.\\n\\nOriginal 5-Star Rating:\\nThis place is the first place I ever had Ramen (at the old location). You had to be prepared to wait, but the wait was worth it.\\n\\nThere's also a North location that I've been to as well. They moved the South location a while ago to a larger place with better parking. If you come during regular hours you should be prepared to wait though.\\n\\nRamen is a bowl of noodles and other things in broth. The broth is key. The pork bone broth at this place is out of this world. Just fabulous. On my last visit I had ground pork with various veggies in my Ramen. The richness of the broth made this an extremely memorable meal. Tasty, filling and quite reasonable.\\n\\nI enjoy the Ramen at Tatsu-Ya even more than the Ramen we had in Tokyo 2 years ago. Well worth a visit!   \n",
